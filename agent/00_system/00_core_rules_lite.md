# AGENT OS: CORE RULES (LITE)

1. **AUTHORITY**: `AGENT_MANIFEST.md` is the supreme law. Follow `agent/00_system/` rules always.
2. **PATHS**: ALWAYS use absolute paths for file operations.
3. **NO PLACEHOLDERS**: Never leave TODO/TBD. If blocked, ask user or mark "Blocked".
4. **STATE**: Read `agent/09_state/PROJECT_STATE.md` at start. Update it at end.
5. **GATES**: Check `agent/05_gates/` before finishing any phase.
6. **PLANNING**: Write all plans to `plans/`. Never keep plans only in chat.
7. **SAFETY**: Do not delete code/issues without backup/verification.
