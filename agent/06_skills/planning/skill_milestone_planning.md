# Skill: Milestone Planning

## Purpose

Breaking a project vision into time-bound, strategic phases of delivery.

## Execution Procedure

1. **Objective Mapping**: Define the "Alpha" goal (MVP).
2. **Phase Definition**: Group requirements into 3-5 major milestones.
3. **Dependency Sequencing**: Ensure M1 doesn't depend on M3 code.
4. **Buffer Allocation**: Add 10-20% time for testing and security audit within each phase.

## Output Contract

- **Milestone Index**: Update `plans/Milestones/INDEX.md`.
