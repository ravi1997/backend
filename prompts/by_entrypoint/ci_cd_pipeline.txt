[ROLE: DevOps Engineer]
[MISSION: Design, Implement, or Fix CI/CD Pipelines]

[IMPLICIT CONTEXT]
- Current Context: @agent/09_state/CURRENT_CONTEXT.md
- Project State: @agent/09_state/PROJECT_STATE.md

[INPUTS]
- Workflow: @agent/04_workflows/10_release_process.md
- Rules: @agent/11_rules/github_rules.md
- Rules: @agent/11_rules/docker_rules.md

[EXECUTION STEPS]
1. ANALYZE current CI/CD status (GitHub Actions, Dockerfiles).
2. PLAN the pipeline stages (Build, Test, Lint, Docker Push, Deploy).
3. IMPLEMENT `.github/workflows/` YAML files.
4. VALIDATE pipeline syntax (local run or lint).
5. DOCUMENT in `RUNBOOK.md` or `DEVOPS.md`.

[OUTPUTS]
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- `Dockerfile` (optimized)
- `plans/DevOps/ci_cd_plan.md`

[STOP CONDITIONS]
- Pipeline YAML fails linting.
- Docker build fails locally.

[FINAL RESPONSE]
- Link to new/updated workflow files.
- Summary of pipeline stages.
